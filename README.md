You can access live deployed website here: www.zolt.ga

All the hierarchy and working of project has been mentioned through comments.

To work with this project on local server, run npm install in both backend and frontent directories.

You need to add you own enviornmental variables like database url, keys, etc. in order to work with it on local server.  But if you don't want that, just go to https://zolt.ga

After you got everything set, run command: npm start , in both frontent and backend directories.

Thank you :)
